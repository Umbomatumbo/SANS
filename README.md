# Statistical Analysis of Networks and Systems

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and reports for the SANS (Statistical Analysis of Networks and Systems). The course is led by José María Barceló and Jorge García Vidal and was completed in January 2024.

## Homework Objectives
The course covers basic techniques used in the statistical analysis of networks and systems. It first reviews and extends basic concepts on probability, information theory, and linear algebra. Then it presents basic estimation techniques. It covers the basic approaches of Machine Learning for regression and classification. Finally presents linear methods for dimensionality reduction.

## Reports
All my work is presented in the reports uploaded in this repository
